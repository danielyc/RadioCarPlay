## Proof of concept CarPlay project without entitlements

This is a quick and dirty Radio streaming CarPlay project to demonstrate deploying a (somewhat useful) CarPlay project utilizing [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).

The application generated by xcode will not contain the correct entitlements. [CarPlay enabler](https://github.com/danielyc/carplay-enabler) can be used to easily add these entitlements.
